This is an R port of Tomioka and Suzuki's SpicyMKL.  
SpicyMKL solves  both binary classification (hinge & logitstic losses) and regression (squared error loss) problems.  
Spicer solves binary classification (logistic only), regression (squared error loss)
and multiclass problems (logistic loss).  
The latter is done by expanding the binary SpicyMKL solver via one-versus-one
class pairs training approach.  
In addition, Spicer outputs class or probability predictions for binary/multiclass classification tasks.  

**Training**\
*Inputs*\
*K* : N x N x M array. the (i,j,m)-element contains the (i,j)-element of the m-th kernel gram matrix.\
*yapp* :  vector of length N with sample labels.  It should be a factor for binary/multiclass classification. \
*C* : regularization parameter . Large values of C induce strong regularization. For L1 regularization C is a scalar: or elasticnet, C is a vector of length 2: C(1)|x| + C(2)x^2/2\
*opt* : list of options which control the behavior of SPICER:
* loss: type of loss function:  'logit' (logistic regression, log(1+exp(- f(x)y))) for classification,'square' (square loss, 0.5*(y - f(x))^2) for regression
* regname: type of regularization: 'l1' (default), 'elasticnet'
* outerMaxIter: maximum number of iteration of outer loop. (default 300)
* innerMaxIter: maximum number of iteration of inner loop. (default 500) -
* stopdualitygap: TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE, Spicer employs duality gap for stopping criterion of outer loop. Default TRUE.  -
* stopIneqViolation: TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE, Spicer employs violation of inequality for stopping criterion of outer loop. Default FALSE
* tolOuter:tollerance of stopping criteria of outer loop. (default 0.001)
* tolInner: tollerance of stopping criteria of inner loop. (default tolOuter/1000) -
* calpha: increment factor of gamma: gamma^(t+1)=calpha*gamma^(t).  (default 10)
* display: 1:display no progress messages, 2(default):display outer loop progress messages, 3:display inner loop progress messaages.

*Output*\
A SPICER model with the following components:
* *comb_alpha* : N x 1 coefficient vector.
* *kern_weight* : 1 x M kernel weight vector, scaled to sum to 1
* *bias* : bias term
* *activeset* : indices of kernels that are active ({m : kern_weight[m] is not zero}).
* *sorted_kern_weight*: vector of non-zero kernel weights sorted by magnitude, scaled to sum to 1.
* *opt* : list of SPICER options used in run
* *history* : contains history of primal objective, dual objective, number of active kernels, and duality gap.

**Prediction**\
*Inputs*\
* *model* SPICER model\
* *kTest* a list of test kernels of dimensions nTrain, nTest, length(model\$sorted_kern_weight) (you can pass extra kernels so long as ones referenced in model\$sorted_kern_weight are included). In the case of multiclass prediction, the third dimension of kTest should include all possible kernels for each pairwise classification task.\
#* *type* - applicable for classification (binary & multiclass) only - "response" returns the predicted class labels, while "probability" returns the class probability (for classification, positive class is the second class label in model\$opt\$classes)\
*Output* \
A prediction vector of length nTest computed by\
f(x) = \sum{model$sorted_kern_weigth[i]*KTest[,,i]}*model$comb_alpha + model$beta\
If prediction task is 'regression', output is continuous valued predictions\
If prediction task is 'classification' and type is 'response' - output is predicted labels.\
If prediction task is 'classification' and type is 'probability' - output is probabilities of positive class (model\$opt\$classes[2])\
